        <h2>Ella</h2>
        <p>The area has a rich bio-diversity, dense with numerous varieties of flora and fauna. Ella is surrounded 
           by hills covered with cloud forests and tea plantations. The town has a cooler climate than surrounding 
           lowlands, due to its elevation. The Ella Gap allows views across the southern plains of Sri Lanka. On a 
           sunny morning, you can even see the glow from the lighthouses along the southern coast.

            <p> By rail. Ella's a few stops from Badulla at the end of the railway line that snakes through the Hill Country. 
                Trains go to Colombo and Kandy from here. The fares are ludicrously cheap in 2nd and 3rd class, and the views spectacular. 
                It's usually no problem getting a seat in 2nd/3rd class going to Colombo or Kandy, as the trains from Badulla are quite empty 
                until reaching Nanu Oya. However the reverse is true going up to Ella and it can be quite crowded until the last 2 or 3 hours of 
                the journey. Ella's railway station itself is prettily quaint. there are many travelers who visit ella by train.</p>

            <p> By Road, Buses go south through Ella Gap to Wellawaya where you can change for a number of destinations in the south of the island.</p>
                

            <p> The climate throughout most of the year is typical of the high Hill Country, with a hot sun by midday, but a moderate air temperature. 
                It will often rain in the afternoon, but only for an hour or so. A sweatshirt, or light jacket is needed at night. In December it can rain a lot!.</p>
                
            <p> Ella has a small post office and one bank (Bank of Ceylon) with an ATM.
                
                There's not much to do in Ella itself, with a handful of small shops and only a few bars/restaurants. It's basically a nicely relaxing base for 
                exploring the surrounding country.
