	  <h2>Overview</h2>
            
	    <center><img src="yala1.webp"></center>

            <p>Although at present Yala is known for its national park, in the bygone days Yala was a center of ancient civilization. Yala; the second largest national park of Sri Lanka is made up of five 
            blocks but only two blocks are open to the public. Even-though Yala was classified as a wildlife sanctuary at first, later it was classified as a national park and is home to 44 varieties of 
            mammals and 215 species of birds. Royal peacocks, the lithe and splendid leopards, the majestic elephants, sloth bears, jackals, buffaloes, monkeys, sambars, spotted dear and crocodiles are some 
            such exotic species. At the same time, Yala also has one of the highest leopard densities in the world. The Tsunami in 2004 caused a lot of damage and destruction to this park. Surprisingly, it was 
            later discovered that no animal was harmed from this disaster.</p>
            
            <p>‘Sithulpawwa’ and ‘Magul Viharaya’ are two religious sites with paramount importance which lies within Yala. ‘Sithulpawwa’also known as ‘Chiththala Pabbatha’is also believed to be a place where around 12,000 
            monks once resided. ‘Magul Viharaya’ marks its importance as an ancient monument where King Kavantissa married princess Viharamahadevi.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            
            <p>In ancient times, Yala was considered to be a center of civilization and as claimed by the historians, King Ravana established his kingdom in Yala. During the period of the Ruhuna Kingdom, agricultural 
            activities seems to have flourished and the numerous tanks that were found in this region are conformations of this rich agricultural civilization. This also displays the advanced irrigational knowledge 
            of the ancient kingdoms. ‘Situlpawwa’; where 12,000 monks were believed to have lived, ‘Magul Maha Viharaya’ built in 1st century BC and the ‘Akasa Chetiya’ built in 2nd century BC are important pilgrimage 
            sites within the ‘Yala National Park’. ‘Mahavansa’ (poem), an outstanding piece of literature written in Pali which conveys the history of Sri Lanka upto the rule of King Mahasen, states that by the end of 13th 
            century AD the Ruhunu Kingdom began to decline in its powers.
            In addition to those, Yala was also an expanse of land used by the resident British for hunting purposes in the past.</p>
