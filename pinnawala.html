        <h2>Pinnawala</h2>
        <p>There are six national parks and three wildlife sanctuaries in the vicinity of Yala. 
            Among the largest is Lunugamvehera National Park. The park is situated in the dry 
            semi-arid climatic region and rain is received mainly during the northeast monsoon.
             Yala hosts a variety of ecosystems ranging from moist monsoon forests to freshwater 
             and marine wetlands. It is one of the 70 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in Sri Lanka. 
             Yala harbours 215 bird species including six endemic species of Sri Lanka. The number 
             of mammals that has been recorded from the park is 44, and it has one of the highest 
             leopard densities in the world. The area around Yala has hosted several ancient civilisations. 
             Two important pilgrim sites, Sithulpahuwa and Magul Vihara, are situated within the park.

            <p> It is situated in the southeast region of the country, and lies in Southern Province and Uva Province. 
                The park covers 979 square kilometers (378 sq. mi) and is located about 300 kilometers (190 mi) from Colombo. 
                Yala was designated as a wildlife sanctuary in 1900, and along with Wilpattu was one of the first two national 
                parks in Sri Lanka, having been designated in 1938. The park is best known for its variety of wild animals. 
                It is important for the conservation of Sri Lankan elephants, Sri Lankan leopards and aquatic birds.

	<h2>Animal welfare</h2>

	<p>Most of the elephants at Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage healthy and once attaining adulthood, will be retained within the facility mostly since they have become dependent on supplied food. A few disabled elephants are given residential care. One tusker, Raja is blind, and one female, named Sama, lost her front right leg to a land mine.</p>

	<p>Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage was the subject of a 2010 report by the Born Free Foundation which called into question animal welfare at the orphanage.</p>

	<p>The quality of care of elephants who are donated from Pinnawala has been a big public issue. In 2012 The Sri Lanka Environment Trust spoke out against authorities who continue to 'donate' tamed elephants to people who had 'poor' past records of taking care of animals. "There are enough cases to show that the authorities are releasing elephants from Pinnawala to the same group of people who don't take care of the animals." Despite these accusations it is proven that the surveillance is done by the fact that four of such donated elephants by presidential decree being returned to the elephant by a court order.</p>
	
	<h2>History</h2>

	<p>The Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage was established by the Sri Lankan Department of Wildlife Conservation in 1975 for feeding and providing care and sanctuary to orphaned baby elephants that were found in the wild. The orphanage was located at the Wilpattu National Park, then shifted to the tourist complex at Bentota and then to the Dehiwala Zoo. From the Zoo it was shifted to Pinnawala village on a 25-acre (10 ha) coconut plantation adjacent to the Maha Oya River. The land was donated to the Government of Sri Lanka by the Adhikaram Mudiyanse Family ( Pinnawala Family) of Kandy.</p>

	<p>The primary residential care area is on the east side of Highway B199, Rambukkana Road. The main site also has some restaurants and refreshment stands, and management buildings including sleeping sheds and veterinary facilities. The elephant bathing and viewing area along the Oya River is directly opposite on the west side of the highway.</p>

	<p>At the time it was settled, the orphanage had five baby elephants which formed its nucleus. The addition of orphans continued till 1995 when the Elephant Transit Home (ETH) adjoining Udawalawe National Park was created by the DWC. Since then, orphaned babies have been taken to the ETH and addition to the Pinnawala herd has been mostly through births occurring there.</p>

	<p>It was planned for the facility to attract local and foreign visitors, the income from which would help to maintain the orphanage. The Pinnawala Orphanage has since become a tourist attraction. In 1978, the orphanage was taken over by the Department of National Zoological Gardens Sri Lanka. In 1982 an elephant breeding program was launched.</p>

	<p>Visitors to the park can view the care and daily routine of the elephants, such as bottle-feeding of elephant calves, feeding of all other elephants, and bathing in the Ma Oya (River).</p>
